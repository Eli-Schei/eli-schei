## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eli Schei, I live in Ski, Norway, and I currently work as a consultant at Point Taken AS. 
I mostly work in the M365-sphere, but I recently joined 'Team Web' at <nho.no> where I get to play with episerver and vue.js (and I'm new to both, so a lot of learning going on - which I love).

### Blog
As a developer I read a lot of blogs. And in my experience I can read multiple different blogposts about exatcly the same topic, and only one of them makes sense to me. Therefore Iâ€™m adding my voice to the mix, and hopefully one of my blogposts will be the one that makes sense of a topic for you.
